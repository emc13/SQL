#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables to quantify and analyze statistics about customer and order data.

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order Id';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE product='iPhone'
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order Id';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers
JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON customers.order_id=FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order Id';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT DISTINCT Product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;

#5.What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? (Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products).*/
SELECT SUM(Quantity)*price AS revenue, 
Product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT
SUM(Quantity),
Product, 
SUM(Quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customers.acctnum),
AVG(Quantity * price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers
ON FebSales.orderID=customers.order_ID
WHERE FebSales.Quantity > 2
AND length(orderID) = 6
